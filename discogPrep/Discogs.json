	"about":"Discogs is the worlds foremost Database, Marketplace, and Community for music. 
The user-built Database boasts a catalog of more than 11 million releases and 6.1 million artists making it the most extensive physical music Database in the world. While Discogs is widely regarded as a place for listing vinyl, CDs, cassettes and other physical media, the site covers digital-only music too. 
It seems unlikely Discogs will ever overcome an insurmountable backlog of unlisted tracks from the digital-only sphere, though. In the 9 months it took Discogs to add 1 million records, for instance, Spotify may have added as many as 5 million songs to their database. Spotify founder Daniel Ek stated that the service is adding some 20,000 new songs to its library every day, and what took Discogs 9 months to add, a second-tier streaming service like Napster adds in six weeks.
